## 4.14.0 (2022-04-12)

* Added new DNS plugin [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) (Thanks @CaiB)
* Added server shortcuts for Google's new ACME CA, GOOGLE_PROD and GOOGLE_STAGE.
* Added server shortcuts for SSL.com, SSLCOM_RSA and SSLCOM_ECC.
* Added `UseAltAccountRefresh` switch to `Set-PAServer` to workaround CAs that don't yet support direct account refreshes such as Google, SSL.com, and DigiCert. (#372) (#394)
  * New configs should have this set by default for CAs known to need it. But you will need to explicitly set it on any existing configs for these CAs.
* Added `LifetimeDays` param on `New-PACertificate`, `New-PAOrder`, and `Set-PAOrder` to enable user requested cert lifetimes for ACME CAs that support the feature.
  * Google's CA is the only free ACME CA known to currently support this and the order lifetime cannot be changed once it is created. Setting a new value on an existing order will only change the lifetime on subsequent renewals.
* Updated Azure plugin to use the latest stable API version.
* Updated Azure guide to account for breaking changes in the Az module.
* Fixed GoDaddy plugin when using it with delegated sub-zones. (#430)
* Fixed `New-PAAccount` when importing an existing key on CAs that require external account binding.
* Reduced the number of account refreshes that happen as part of normal operations.
